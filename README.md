If you find any bugs due to carelessness on our part in organizing the code, feel free to contact us and point that!

### Installation
  Please install the dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  - Note that we have updated the corresponding code about light adapter in the code of diffusers, thus please utilie the diffusers in this repo to replace the original diffusers.

  We have provided the pretrained model weights and the pretrained CLIP image encoder weights. Please download them from here.



#### Inference 
- Please use the following command to perform inference for single or a group of images:
  ```
  python test/test.py
  ```
- Note that you should change the 'xxx/xxx' in test.py to the path of your corresponding path.
